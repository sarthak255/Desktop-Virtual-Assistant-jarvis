# Security Policy

## Overview
We take the security of our Desktop Virtual Assistant project seriously. This document outlines our security policy, including how to report vulnerabilities and our commitment to addressing security issues promptly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to report it to us responsibly. Please follow these steps:

1. **Contact Us**: Send an email by [click here](mailto:sarthakgoel62@gmail.com) with the details of the vulnerability. Include:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any relevant logs or screenshots
2. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it. Public disclosure before a fix is available may put users at risk.
3. **Confirmation**: You will receive a confirmation of your report within 48 hours. We will work with you to understand the issue and develop a fix.
4. **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days. Non-critical issues may take longer depending on complexity and severity.

## Supported Versions
We actively support and release security updates for the following versions of the Desktop Virtual Assistant:

- Version 1.0 and above

Older versions may not receive updates. We recommend upgrading to the latest version to ensure you have the most recent security enhancements.

## Security Best Practices
To ensure the security of your installation of the Desktop Virtual Assistant, we recommend the following best practices:

1. **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update to the latest version of the Desktop Virtual Assistant to receive security patches and new features.
2. **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure that any passwords or API keys used in the configuration are strong and unique.
3. **Secure Environment**: Run the application in a secure environment. Avoid running it with unnecessary administrative privileges.
4. **Regular Backups**: Perform regular backups of your data to prevent data loss in case of a security incident.
5. **Monitor Dependencies**: Keep an eye on updates and security advisories for any third-party dependencies used in the project.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy
We believe in responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. We request that security researchers:
- Give us reasonable time to respond to and fix the vulnerability before disclosing it to the public.
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability or accessing user data without permission.
- Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.
